      ## Type of metrics grouping; available options are:
      ##   tablepermetric -- for one table per distinct metric
      ##   singletable    -- for writing all metrics to the same table
      # metrics_grouping_type = "tablepermetric"

      ## Disable when running with the lowest possible permissions i.e. table ingestor role.

      ##  Ingestion method to use; available options are
      ##    - managed  --  streaming ingestion with fallback to batched ingestion or the "queued" method below

  ## Using this section the plugin will send metrics to an EventStream endpoint

  ## any code.

    ## Partition key
    ## Metric tag or field name to use for the event partition key. The value of
    ## this tag or field is set as the key for events if it exists. If both, tag
    ## and field, exist the tag is preferred.

    ## Set the maximum batch message size in bytes  
    ## The allowable size depends on the Event Hub tier; not setting this option or setting  
    ## it to zero will use the default size of the Azure Event Hubs Client library. See  
    ##   https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quotas#basic-vs-standard-vs-premium-vs-dedicated-tiers

    ## Data format to output.
    ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
